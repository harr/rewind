It's within this context that I fear for Lemuria, even with a promising debut in tow. Because their sales pitch can definitely double as a dealbreaker for some: This sounds just like 1993...\"", "band": "Lemuria", "record_cover": "/static/img/lemuriaGetBetter.jpg", "current_buyers": "420", "days_to_go": "26"}}, "users": {"harrismendell": {"username": "harrismendell", "password": "superman1"}, "harris2": {"username": "harris2", "password": "superman1"}, "harris": {"username": "harris", "password": "superman1"}}}
