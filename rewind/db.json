Maybe it's a sign I need to spend less time talking with other music writers, because the consensus appears to be an overwhelming, 'dear fucking god,' TOTALLY. Maybe I'm just naive, having exited the decade as a teen, but Pinkerton, the NHL 92-96, Higher Learning...we had some good times, right? It's within this context that I fear for Lemuria, even with a promising debut in tow.

Layers upon layers of treated and raw sounds blend into a thick headtrip. Piano, cello, sleighbells, keyboards, chimes, and more can be excavated from the mix.

For all the emphasis placed on his unhappy backstory and the distressing nature of his death, Smith left behind a body of work that defies and exceeds any stereotyping. Sadness may be the easiest emotional current to pick up on in his songs, but Smith's expressive range was as wide as it was subtle; his music could be angry, funny, hopeful, and despondent, often at the same time. New Moon collects two CDs' worth of material recorded around the same time as 1995's Elliott Smith and its 1997 follow-up Either/Or, and unlike typical posthumous releases (not to mention second ones), is a genuinely worthy addition to a stunningly consistent catalog.\"", "band": "Elliot Smith", "record_cover": "/static/img/newmoon.jpg", "current_buyers": "1531", "max_buyers": "2000"}, {"review_snippet": "\"God bless middle school bullies: without the torment they\u2019ve reliably inflicted on generation after generation of brooding, musically-inclined creative types, would there even be indie rock?
