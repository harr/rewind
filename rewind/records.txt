Maybe it's a sign I need to spend less time talking with other music writers, because the consensus appears to be an overwhelming, \'dear fucking god,\' TOTALLY. Maybe I'm just naive, having exited the decade as a teen, but Pinkerton, the NHL 92-96, Higher Learning...we had some good times, right? It's within this context that I fear for Lemuria, even with a promising debut in tow. Because their sales pitch can definitely double as a dealbreaker for some: This sounds just like 1993...\"", "26"

But from its opening moments, you get the sense that she\'s ready for it, the newfound assurance, steadiness, and clarity of her voice immediately obvious. \"We are late, we are loud, we remain connected as you\'re reading out loud,\" she sings on the smolderingly evocative opener, \"Hollow Bedroom\". Like American Weekend, it begins with just a guitar and a voice, though this time the instrument's plugged in and the recording sounds more professional. (It was still recorded at home, this time in the Philadelphia house she shares with her sister and bandmates.) But it's no less intimate-- if anything, the clean recording only brings you in tighter.\"", "25")

For all the emphasis placed on his unhappy backstory and the distressing nature of his death, Smith left behind a body of work that defies and exceeds any stereotyping. Sadness may be the easiest emotional current to pick up on in his songs, but Smith's expressive range was as wide as it was subtle; his music could be angry, funny, hopeful, and despondent, often at the same time. New Moon collects two CDs' worth of material recorded around the same time as 1995's Elliott Smith and its 1997 follow-up Either/Or, and unlike typical posthumous releases (not to mention second ones), is a genuinely worthy addition to a stunningly consistent catalog.\"", "4")
